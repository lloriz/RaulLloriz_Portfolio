# Data Projects


Welcome to my data portfolio.

In this repository there are several projects that demonstrate my skills working with different amounts of data as well as my level of programming with Python.


## Projects

1. [Loading and Transformation data in Databricks [PySpark]](https://github.com/lloriz/RaulLloriz_Portfolio/blob/main/Loading%20and%20Transformation%20data%20in%20Databricks%20%5BPySpark%5D/TransformDataInstance_BB.ipynb)
   - **Description:** This is a small notebook that I work with daily. On this occasion, it is a loading and transformation of data for later ingestion into databases.
   - **Technologies Used:** Due to its automation capabilities through Azure Data Factory, Databricks has been chosen to create these ETL processes that will be launched daily by the orchestrator. The code is written with PySpark.
   - **Results:** We load the raw data provided by the client, perform the relevant transformations and prepare the final Parquet for ingestion into the database.

2. [Video Game Sales [Data Cleaning and Dashboard with POWER BI]](https://github.com/lloriz/RaulLloriz_Portfolio/tree/main/Videogame_Data_Cleaning_and_Visual%5BPYTHON%20%26%20POWER%20BI%5D)
   - **Description:** In this project, we chose a dataset of video game sales which are related between platforms, rating, etc. // We discovered that some data is wrong, such as games with a large number of sales that their rating does not correspond to, so we fixed it.
We prepare the data for its previous interactive visualization with Power BI
   - **Technologies Used:** EDA and Data Preparation in Python Notebook with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn // Dashboard with Canva and Power BI
   - **Results:** It is a representation through time of video game sales and developers through time and different platforms; Sony, Nintendo, XBOX

3. [Sleep Health Prediction and EDA [Random Forest]](https://github.com/lloriz/RaulLloriz_Portfolio/tree/main/Sleep%20Health%20%20EDA%20%26%20Model%5BRandom%20Forest%5D)
   - **Description:** This notebook aims to analyze and visualize the relationship between the characteristics of a group of people and their willingness to suffer from a sleep disorder. // For the prediction we have used the well-known Random Forest, since in previous predictions it has given us good results.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Random Forest and Scaler in Scikit-learn Pipeline for the predictions and F1 Score and Accuracy for the metrics
   - **Results:** The Random Forest gave 88% accuracy. It predicts looking nothing and sleep apnea much better than insomnia.

4. [Spotify Popularity Analysis](https://github.com/lloriz/RaulLloriz_Portfolio/tree/main/Popularity_Analysis_Spotify_Top_50_Songs)
   -  **Description:** Data cleaning and Visualization (Popularity Analysis from Spotify Top 50 Chart)
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and word_tokenize to analyze which words are repeated the most in the titles of the most successful songs.
   - **Results:** In the top 50 songs on Spotify, the words that are repeated the most are related to love songs or that can talk about love.
