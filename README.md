# Data Science / Analyst Projects


Welcome to my data scientist portfolio.

In this repository there are several projects that demonstrate my skills working with different amounts of data as well as my level of programming with Python.


## Projects
1. [Video Game Sales [Data Cleaning and Dashboard with POWER BI]](https://github.com/lloriz/RaulLloriz_Portfolio/tree/main/Videogame_Data_Cleaning_and_Visual%5BPYTHON%20%26%20POWER%20BI%5D)
   - **Description:** In this project, we chose a dataset of video game sales which are related between platforms, rating, etc. // We discovered that some data is wrong, such as games with a large number of sales that their rating does not correspond to, so we fixed it.
We prepare the data for its previous interactive visualization with Power BI
   - **Technologies Used:** EDA and Data Preparation in Python Notebook with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn // Dashboard with Canva and Power BI
   - **Results:** It is a representation through time of video game sales and developers through time and different platforms; Sony, Nintendo, XBOX
